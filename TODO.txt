it is clear that the "tracked_object_covariance" blows up after being tipped
passed a certain value , inexorably leading to a new object being created... fix
root cause

include instructions and launch files for calibrating camera.
link to checkerboard or make a local copy.
- calibrate
- enforce that camera is calibrated and test calibration periodically / warn?
- test i can track flies reliably with this lens / camera
	 - order if so
- test lighting works (waiting on power supply from digikey?)

- run multi_tracker setup.py in install scripts
- or package it for / with Floris and install from ppa / repo?
  python package?

- transition .py config files to .yaml?

- fix delta video / rosbag save nodes so bagfile size doesnt blow up even if
  nothing is being published?

- install node files?

- make configuration files immutable once data acquisition is launched (in another node?)
  - maybe in metatools?

- should crash if no configs (or at least warn heavily)
- should crash if no disk space

- change all debug_flags (and self.debug sets/checks) to use logdebug and
  changing node debug levels

- move trajectory editor to scripts? & change path to ui files and such
- have an alternate setup.py for installing the analysis libraries standalone?

- I've seen both BSD and MIT referenced. should we (Floris) try to pick just one?

- make vagrant use host ssh key for Github?

- take background image w/o ROI mask for orienting arena

- support for tracking during experiment on another computer
  both with a need for feedback and without
  - in case without, could transfer segments of data, checksum, track, repeat
  - need for checksum?

- w/ tracking for choice experiments: am i re-ordering ROIs in re-formatting, but
  maybe not appropriately numbering HDF5 output?

- make param for max # ROIs expected in roi_finder, and err if over
  - also err if overlapping? (by at least a certain amount?)
  - or if one is an anomalous shape / size?
