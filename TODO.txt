it is clear that the "tracked_object_covariance" blows up after being tipped passed a certain value
, inexorably leading to a new objet being created... fix root cause

include instructions and launch files for calibrating camera.
link to checkerboard or make a local copy.
-calibrate
-enforce that camera is calibrated and test calibration periodically / warn?
-test i can track flies reliably with this lens / camera
	-order if so
-test lighting works (waiting on power supply from digikey?)

-run multi_tracker setup.py in install scripts
-or package it for / with floris and install from ppa / repo?
 python package?

-transition .py config files to .yaml?

-fix delta video / rosbag save nodes so bagfile size doesnt blow up even if nothing is being published?

-install node files?

-make configuration files immutable once data acquisition is launched (in another node?)
    -maybe in metatools?

-should crash if no configs (or at least warn heavily)
-should crash if no disk space

-change all debug_flags (and self.debug sets/checks) to use logdebug and changing node debug levels

-move trajectory editor to scripts? & change path to ui files and such
-have an alternate setup.py for installing the analysis libraries standalone?

-i've seen both BSD and MIT referenced. should we (Floris) try to pick just one?

-make vagrant use host ssh key for github?

-take background image w/o ROI mask for orienting arena
