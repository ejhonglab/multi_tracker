rename save_* to be more descriptive of which information they are saving

make a node that just crops and masks roi (or at least masks) and republishes image?
	-and then (at least optionally) delete the code that currently does that in
	 all of tracker_..., delta_video_simplebuffer, and liveviewer

fix (what appears to be) data association across rois!
	-show what available image looks like in cognate image processor
	 (should be masked)
	 -> so cognate contour topic should only correspond to roi
	 + cognate data associator should only be subscribing to this contour topic, right?
